## 2.1.1.2 - Vehicle data decoder/encoder

Objectives

Learn how to:

use the json module and its basic facilities;
encode and decode JSON strings from/to Python objects.

Scenario
Take a look at these two screenshots. They present two different use cases of the same program:

Your task is to write a code which has exactly the same conversation with the user and:

1. defines a class named Vehicle, whose objects can carry the vehicle data shown above (the structure of the class should be deducted from the above dialog â€” call it "reverse engineering" if you want)

2. defines a class able to encode the Vehicle object into an equivalent JSON string;

3. defines a class able to decode the JSON string into the newly created Vehicle object.

Of course, some basic data validity checks should be done, too.
